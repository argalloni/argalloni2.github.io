abstract: Anatomical similarity across the neocortex has led to the common assumption
  that the circuitry is modular and performs stereotyped computations. Layer 5 pyramidal
  neurons (L5PNs) in particular are thought to be central to cortical computation
  because of their extensive arborisation and nonlinear dendritic operations. Here,
  we demonstrate that computations associated with dendritic Catextsuperscript2+ plateaus
  in mouse L5PNs vary substantially between the primary and secondary visual cortices.
  L5PNs in the secondary visual cortex show reduced dendritic excitability and smaller
  propensity for burst firing. This reduced excitability is correlated with shorter
  apical dendrites. Using numerical modelling, we uncover a universal principle underlying
  the influence of apical length on dendritic backpropagation and excitability, based
  on a Natextsuperscript+ channel-dependent broadening of backpropagating action potentials.
  In summary, we provide new insights into the modulation of dendritic excitability
  by apical dendrite length and show that the operational repertoire of L5PNs is not
  universal throughout the brain.
