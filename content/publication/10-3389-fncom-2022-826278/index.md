abstract: 'It is generally appreciated that storing memories of specific events in
  the mammalian brain, and associating features of the environment with behavioral
  outcomes requires fine-tuning of the strengths of connections between neurons through
  synaptic plasticity. It is less understood whether the organization of neuronal
  circuits comprised of multiple distinct neuronal cell types provides an architectural
  prior that facilitates learning and memory by generating unique patterns of neuronal
  activity in response to different stimuli in the environment, even before plasticity
  and learning occur. Here we simulated a neuronal network responding to sensory stimuli,
  and systematically determined the effects of specific neuronal cell types and connections
  on three key metrics of neuronal sensory representations: sparsity, selectivity,
  and discriminability. We found that when the total amount of input varied considerably
  across stimuli, standard feedforward and feedback inhibitory circuit motifs failed
  to discriminate all stimuli without sacrificing sparsity or selectivity. Interestingly,
  networks that included dedicated excitatory feedback interneurons based on the mossy
  cells of the hippocampal dentate gyrus exhibited improved pattern separation, a
  result that depended on the indirect recruitment of feedback inhibition. These results
  elucidate the roles of cellular diversity and neural circuit architecture on generating
  neuronal representations with properties advantageous for memory storage and recall.'
