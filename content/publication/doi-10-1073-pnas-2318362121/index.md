abstract: 'Design of hardware based on biological principles of neuronal computation
  and plasticity in the brain is a leading approach to realizing energy- and sample-efficient
  AI and learning machines. An important factor in selection of the hardware building
  blocks is the identification of candidate materials with physical properties suitable
  to emulate the large dynamic ranges and varied timescales of neuronal signaling.
  Previous work has shown that the all-or-none spiking behavior of neurons can be
  mimicked by threshold switches utilizing material phase transitions. Here, we demonstrate
  that devices based on a prototypical metal-insulator-transition material, vanadium
  dioxide (VO2), can be dynamically controlled to access a continuum of intermediate
  resistance states. Furthermore, the timescale of their intrinsic relaxation can
  be configured to match a range of biologically relevant timescales from milliseconds
  to seconds. We exploit these device properties to emulate three aspects of neuronal
  analog computation: fast (~1 ms) spiking in a neuronal soma compartment, slow (~100
  ms) spiking in a dendritic compartment, and ultraslow (~1 s) biochemical signaling
  involved in temporal credit assignment for a recently discovered biological mechanism
  of one-shot learning. Simulations show that an artificial neural network using properties
  of VO2 devices to control an agent navigating a spatial environment can learn an
  efficient path to a reward in up to fourfold fewer trials than standard methods.
  The phase relaxations described in our study may be engineered in a variety of materials
  and can be controlled by thermal, electrical, or optical stimuli, suggesting further
  opportunities to emulate biological learning in neuromorphic hardware.'
